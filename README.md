# R-statistical-analysis

The relationship between cigarette smoking and body weight has been studied in Western countries for more than a century, 
either comparing body weights between current smokers and nonsmokers or evaluating the effect of smoking on weight change over time.


This analysis seeks to answer questions like:

- What relationship exists between the weight of respondents and their desired weight
- Is there any association between gender and general health status
- What is the confidence interval for the population mean of body mass index, and many more.
